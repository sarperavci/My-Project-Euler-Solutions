# My Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the Project Euler tasks. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative solutions. This repository serves as a showcase of my problem-solving skills and an opportunity to learn from others' solutions.
## About Project Euler
Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website that hosts a collection of mathematically-oriented programming problems. These problems are designed to be solved using algorithms and require a combination of mathematical insight and programming skills to find efficient solutions. The problems range in difficulty and cover various mathematical concepts and algorithms.

## Solutions
For each problem, the corresponding README file (README.md) gives a brief overview of the problem statement. The code itself in the **solution.cpp** file is extensively documented, explaining the approach, methodology, and any relevant insights used to solve the problem. The code is designed to be self-explanatory, allowing readers to understand the solution by studying the code directly.

## Usage
To use the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the desired problem directory.
3. Read the brief problem summary in the README file (**README.md**).
4. Open the corresponding solution file (**solution.cpp**) and review the code and the inline comments explaining the approach.
5. Compile and run the solution file using a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) to obtain the answer.

## Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that Project Euler encourages independent problem solving. It is considered unethical to share or publish full solutions online during the contest period. Ensure that you have solved the problems independently and only use this repository as a reference after solving them on your own.
